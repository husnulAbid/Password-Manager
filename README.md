# Password-Manager

This application enables password storage on local machines, giving users complete control over their sensitive information without exposing it to external companies or third-party services. Users can add, edit and remove passwords with the corresponding username and URL. It is also possible to copy the password value and navigate to the URL directly from the application. 

Anyone can use the application by downloading the 'Password Storer App.zip' file.
